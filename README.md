## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ Lin's solution to this front-end coding challenge 

Thanks for checking out this Lin's front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this testimonial slider and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## Lin's goal for doing this challenge

- Practice mobile first development
- Pay Attention to design detail - develop the final slider as close to the design image as possible
- Practice using CSS Flexbox
- Keep track of time spent on the project 
- **Have fun building!** ðŸš€
